# awdb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/awdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/awdb)

This is a database, stored in-browser, to support the distribution of a magazine. Still very preliminary.

## On dialects

There’s a haphazard mixture here of CoffeeScript and JavaScript, as well as Emblem and Handlebars. I’ve historically appreciated time-saving whitespace-aware formats, but I’m thinking about abandoning them for [various](http://www.samselikoff.com/blog/one-reason-to-stop-using-coffeescript/) [reasons](https://github.com/machty/emblem.js/issues/189). Once I’ve decided, I’ll update everything to use the same formats consistently.
